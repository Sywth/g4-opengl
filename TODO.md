- [ ] Modifiy `./src/gl_debug.hpp` to not use any macros; prefer `constexpr` and `template` techniques
- [ ] Modifiy camera code to be better designed; have less state and modifications and actually use the quaternion orientation
- [ ] Finish step https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera and really understand the gram-schmidt process and try using that instead of just using glm::lookAt
- [ ] Add camera movement
- [ ] Make current logger.hpp more configurable for user (i.e. we shouldn't have to go into the header to change the log level)
